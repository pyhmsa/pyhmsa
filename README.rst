pyHMSA is a pure Python implementation of the MSA / MAS / AMAS HyperDimensional 
Data File (HMSA, for short) specifications. 
This file format is intended to be a common exchange format for microscopy and 
microanalysis data. 
More information about the file format and its specifications can be found 
`here <http://www.csiro.au/luminescence/HMSA/index.html>`_.

The library is designed to be minimalist, leaving post-processing of the data
to the user's script.
The only dependency of pyHMSA is to `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_, in order
to represent the multi-dimensional data.

pyHMSA is written to support both Python 2 and 3.

The library is provided under the MIT license.

pyHMSA was developed as part of the doctorate thesis project of 
Philippe T. Pinard at RWTH Aachen University (Aachen, Germany) under the 
supervision of Dr. Silvia Richter.
